	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p> Hi, my name is Drew Gaarenstroom and I am from Laguna Beach, CA. I have 3 brothers, one of whom is an identical twin that attends San Diego State University. I have two wonderful dogs and unfortuantly I have 4 cats, that are old, fat and lazy. 1</p>
	<p> Ever since I was in the fifth, I have been in love..... with my beatiful rotweiller german shepard mix, named Bear Frederick Gaarenstroom. His lucious fur coat and marbel brown eyes is a match to none. Recently accompaniny bear is his sister, who is a one year old white German Sheperad. Altough Bear is clearly the more handsomed and favored dog, we still feed her. 2</p>
